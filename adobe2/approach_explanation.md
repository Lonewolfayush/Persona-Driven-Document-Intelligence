# Persona-Driven Document Intelligence Approach

## Overview
Our solution implements a lightweight, CPU-only document intelligence system that extracts and ranks document sections based on persona-specific relevance. The approach emphasizes efficiency, generalizability, and accuracy within the given constraints.

## Core Methodology

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Using `pdfplumber` for robust text extraction with layout preservation
- **Section Identification**: Rule-based and pattern-matching approaches to identify document sections
- **Content Structuring**: Hierarchical parsing to maintain document organization

### 2. Persona Understanding
- **Role Analysis**: Extract key expertise domains and focus areas from persona descriptions
- **Keyword Expansion**: Generate related terms and concepts using semantic similarity
- **Context Building**: Create persona-specific knowledge graphs for relevance assessment

### 3. Job-to-be-Done Modeling
- **Task Decomposition**: Break down complex jobs into constituent information needs
- **Priority Mapping**: Identify primary, secondary, and supporting information requirements
- **Success Criteria**: Define what constitutes relevant and useful content for the task

### 4. Relevance Scoring Algorithm
- **Multi-factor Scoring**: Combines semantic similarity, keyword relevance, and structural importance
- **Persona-Job Alignment**: Weighted scoring based on persona expertise and job requirements
- **Section Ranking**: Probabilistic ranking with confidence scores

### 5. Sub-section Analysis
- **Granular Extraction**: Identify key sentences and paragraphs within relevant sections
- **Content Refinement**: Remove noise and enhance readability while preserving meaning
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain relationships between sub-sections and parent content

## Technical Implementation

### Lightweight NLP Models
- **Sentence Transformers**: Use compact models (â‰¤1GB) for semantic embedding
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Classical approaches for keyword-based relevance
- **Rule-based Processing**: Efficient pattern matching for document structure

### Performance Optimizations
- **Batch Processing**: Parallel processing of documents where possible
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching of embeddings and intermediate results
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large document collections

### Generalization Strategy
- **Domain-agnostic Features**: Extract universal document characteristics
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamic adjustment based on document types and persona complexity
- **Modular Architecture**: Pluggable components for different document formats and domains

## Quality Assurance
- **Validation Framework**: Comprehensive testing with diverse document types and personas
- **Relevance Metrics**: Quantitative measures for section and sub-section quality
- **Error Handling**: Robust processing of malformed or complex documents

This approach ensures high-quality, persona-driven document analysis while meeting all performance and resource constraints.
